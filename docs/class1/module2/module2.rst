For each section, follow the instruction of the class moderator on when
to begin. Carefully read and implement each item step by step.  For
convenience, archives have been created for each lab section ahead of
time.  You can load that archive and start at the beginning of that lab
or return to a lab to cover material at a later time.

To load an archive, ensure that you use the \ **tmsh no-license** option.
For the command syntax, refer to the following example:

    tmsh load sys ucs [ucs file name] no-license
