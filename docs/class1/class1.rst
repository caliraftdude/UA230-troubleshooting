Presented by: Buu Lam, Dan Holland, Jason Chiu, Jeff Nalbone

Welcome
-------
Welcome to the UA 230 Troubleshooting Universal Access Lab. These lab
exercises will instruct you on how to configure and troubleshoot common
Access Policy Manager (APM) issues as experienced by field engineers,
support engineers and customers. This guide is intended to complement
lecture material provided during the UA 230 course as well as a
reference guide that can be referred to after the class as a basis for
troubleshooting APM in your own environment.


Expected time to complete: **4 hours**

Modules
---------------
The first module provides instruction on how to setup the lab.  Only ONE of
the labs in this module needs to be performed.  Once setup is completed,
the second module then progresses through troubleshooting labs.  For
covenience, an archive was created for each lab in this module which will
allow you to load the archive and then begin progress at the beginning of that
lab.
