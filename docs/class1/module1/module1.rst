General Notes
-------------
Provisioning Access Policy Manager (APM) is not required for basic
Access Policy uses cases although this has been provisioned for you
ahead of time. This was done to save time as provisioning often requires
services to restart which takes away valuable lecture/lab time.

Accessing the Lab Environment
-----------------------------
To access the lab environment, you will require a web browser and Remote
Desktop Protocol (RDP) client software. The web browser will be used to
access the Lab Training Portal. The RDP client will be used to connect
to the Jump Host, where you will be able to access the BIG-IP management
interfaces (HTTPS, SSH).

Your class instructor will provide additional lab access details.
